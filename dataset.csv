@BernieSanders Putin makes the unthinkable thinkable; his threats to deploy WMDs in Ukraine would likely unleash WW3! Something's seriously wrong with Putin's thinking if he thinks that'd be a viable way to win the war. He forgets about MAD (mutually assured destruction) https://t.co/dON6GKYsWb,1,1
"@florencerounda2 Update, just checked and eBay does still appear to be trading in Russia, although they say they have suspended their GSP in Russia *and* Ukraine...That is not at all the same as not trading there. Very disappointed with such a big global brand and household name, very bad @eBay https://t.co/1DfK302AZd",1,1
@handelsblatt There is no space on earth for ruthless Russian murderers like #Putin and his army! Hunt them down and bring them to justice! Shame on #Scholz delaying heavy weapons and air defense for Ukraine! Boycott Russia NOW!,1,1
